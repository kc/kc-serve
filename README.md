Create and serve [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) presentations with ease.

Inspired by [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md).

Just 3 simple steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code (or any other lightweight IDE)
1. Start `kc-cli serve` from the (integrated) terminal
1. Create a `./slides` folder and add markdown slides 

Some tips:

* Order slides with a number prefix
* Group slides in subdirectories (creating vertical slides)
* Make image slides directly from `jpg`, `gif` and `svg`
* Inject custom css from a `./css` folder
* Put images in an `./img` folder and refer from markdown using `![alt-text](img/your-image.jpg)`

For more examples and usage see `kc help`.

The only supported theme currently is designed for [Info Support b.v.](http://infosupport.com) and the non-configurable highlight theme is `vs.css`.
